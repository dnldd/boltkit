Each api endpoint should:
1. Assert the incoming request has the required access level for the request.
2. Assert all required parameters have been provided by the incoming request.
3. Process all parameters into expected formats required by the processing func.
4. Send the request payload to the processing func.
5. Respond to the request with the returned value from the processing func.
